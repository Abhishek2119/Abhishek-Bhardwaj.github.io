        <h1>Semi-Final 1</h1>
        <p class="para">The first semi-final between <b>India</b> and <b>New Zealand</b> was played at <b>Old Trafford,
                Manchester</b>. Batting first, New Zealand lost opener Martin Guptill in the fourth over, having scored
            just one run. However, the Indians found wickets hard to come by after that, as Kane Williamson combined
            with Henry Nicholls and Ross Taylor for partnerships of 68 and 65 respectively. Williamson managed 67 runs
            before he was the third man out in the 36th over, a score matched by Taylor when rain stopped play in the
            47th over with New Zealand at 211/5 following the wickets of Neesham and De Grandhomme. No further play was
            possible on the day, so the match went into its reserve day. Taylor managed another seven runs to top-score
            for the Kiwis, who managed to get the score to <b>239/8 at the end of their 50 overs</b>. The Indian chase
            got off to a poor start with India falling to 5/3 in the fourth over, with the top three batsmen all going
            for one run each, then 24/4 after 10 overs. After a small partnership of 47 runs for the fifth wicket
            between Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja was joined by MS Dhoni for a century partnership for
            the seventh wicket that left India needing 37 runs from the final three overs. <b>This game turned out to be
                MS Dhoni's final game for India,</b> he retired from all formats in August 2020. Once Dhoni had gone
            (run out), a late-order collapse saw <b>New Zealand take the last four wickets for just 13 runs,</b> sending
            them into their <b>second consecutive World Cup final.</b></p>

        <h1>Semi-Final 2</h1>
        <p class="para">The second semi-final saw <b>England take on Australia at Edgbaston</b>. Australia won the toss
            and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to
            Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 into the seventh over. Wicket-keeper Alex Carey was promoted up the
            order due to his recent form, and, after getting his helmet knocked off by a Jofra Archer bouncer, he scored
            46 before being caught by Adil Rashid. As wickets continued to tumble at the other end, Steve Smith held his
            wicket to top-score with 85 as <b>Australia were bowled out for 223 </b>with Woakes and Rashid being the
            best of the bowlers with three wickets each. England took their time to get going in the run chase but were
            soon making progress, reaching 124 before Jonny Bairstow was trapped LBW by Starc for the first wicket.
            Quick-hitting Jason Roy went two overs later to a controversial decision, caught behind off a bouncer that
            appeared not to touch his bat, but England had already used their review on Bairstow's wicket, and Roy
            departed for 85 off 65 balls, including five sixes. Nevertheless, England were well over halfway to their
            target by this point, and an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan saw them
            home to an <b> eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.</b></p>
