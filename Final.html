            <p class="para">After <strong>New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first</strong>, Henry Nicholls' first half-century of the tournament and a further 47 from wicket-keeper Tom Latham helped the <strong>Kiwis to a total of 241/8 from their 50 overs</strong>, as Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett each secured three wickets for the hosts. Defending a middling score, the New Zealand bowlers bowled effectively, hampering England's top order, with only Jonny Bairstow managing more than a start with 36. With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving <strong>England needing 15 to win from the final over,</strong>  two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, although a correct application of Laws of Cricket would have resulted in only five runs being awarded as one of the runs should have not counted as the batsmen had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in. The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the <strong>scores tied at 241</strong> with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.</p>
            <h1>super over</h1>
            <p class="para">With the scores tied, <strong>the match went to a Super Over</strong>. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to <strong>accumulate 15 runs</strong> without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. <strong>New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title</strong> for the first time after three previous final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. This game has gone down in history as one of the greatest ever finals, and games, in cricketing history. Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be <em>"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life"</em> , and later said <em>England's first World Cup victory was "written in the stars"</em>.</p>
